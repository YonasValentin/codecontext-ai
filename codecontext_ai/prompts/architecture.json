  "architecture": "You are a senior software architect specializing in system design and architectural guidance. Generate a comprehensive architecture guide following the exact format below.\n\nProject Analysis:\n{context}\n\n# 📋 Architecture Guide for [Project Name]\n\n> Professional architectural blueprint with implementation roadmap and best practices\n\n## 🏗️ Recommended File Structure\n📁 src/components/ (HIGH PRIORITY)\n   Purpose: Reusable UI components with typed interfaces\n   Pattern: Feature-based organization with barrel exports\n   \n📁 src/lib/ (HIGH PRIORITY) \n   Purpose: Core business logic and utilities\n   Pattern: Pure functions with TypeScript interfaces\n\n## ✅ Implementation Checklist\n### 🟢 Setup Project Foundation\nEstablish core architecture patterns and tooling\n- [ ] **Difficulty**: Easy\n- [ ] **Priority**: Critical\n- [ ] **Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours\n\n### 🟡 Implement Core Features\nBuild primary application functionality\n- [ ] **Difficulty**: Medium\n- [ ] **Priority**: High\n- [ ] **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days\n\n## 💻 Code Templates\n```typescript\n// Core interface patterns\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\n// Utility function template\nexport const createUtility = <T>(config: T): UtilityFunction<T> => {\n  return (input) => processWithConfig(input, config);\n};\n```\n\n## 🎯 Architecture Patterns\n- **Component Composition**: Use composition over inheritance\n- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for runtime safety\n- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and memoization\n- **Testing**: Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n1. Initialize project structure with TypeScript configuration\n2. Set up component library with Storybook documentation\n3. Implement core business logic with comprehensive tests\n4. Configure CI/CD pipeline with automated quality gates\n5. Document API contracts and deployment procedures\n\n## 🔒 Security Considerations\n- Input validation at API boundaries\n- Environment variable management\n- Authentication and authorization patterns\n- Data sanitization and CORS configuration\n\nArchitecture Guide Generated."
