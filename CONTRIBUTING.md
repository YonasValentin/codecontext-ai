- Implement privacy tests to prevent data leakage

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
1. Create an issue describing the problem or feature
2. Use descriptive branch names (`feature/improved-readme-model`)
3. Keep changes focused and reviewable
4. Include tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation for user-facing changes

### Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Model Contributions

### Training New Models
1. Ensure high-quality, diverse training data
2. Conduct comprehensive benchmarks before submission
3. Provide clear training methodology and results
4. Include reproducible configurations and instructions
5. Consider model size vs performance trade-offs

### Model Naming Convention
- Format: `codecontext-{task}-{size}b`
- Examples: `codecontext-readme-7b`, `codecontext-api-13b`
- Tasks: readme, api, changelog, docstring
- Size: Parameter count in billions

### Quality Standards
- BLEU score > 0.4 on standard benchmarks
- Human evaluation score > 7/10
- Inference time < 5s on RTX 4090
- Documented and optimized memory usage
